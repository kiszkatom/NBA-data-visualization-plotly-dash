We pick season, team and oponnent and date. Opponent team and date are dropdown selector. It means if I pick atlanta as Team i can't get atlanta as opponent team. When I picked both teams i can choose only the dates on which the two teams played together.

Data weights over 500mb so i can't load it here.
